# YouTube Age Faker

<hr>

YouTube is introcuding a new feature which uses machine learning to estimate your age and forces you to doxx yourself if it flags you as a child. [Learn More](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/extending-our-built-in-protections-to-more-teens-on-youtube/)

This script spams your watch history with adult content to ensure that YouTube thinks you are an adult, no matter what you watch.
